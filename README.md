# Serial-Comm-Tester
Serial Communications Test Tool 

Serial Comm Tester is written by Philip Murray and released under the GPL-V2 License.

Contributors and collaborators are welcome !!!!!

This started as a basic Serial communications test tool that i created for when at work to make my life easier.

Alot of other Serial programs are BUGGY as hell so i made my own and added to it over time.

My Goal is to add features like Modbus , 12c and other protocols or if someone want's to contribute or collaborate i would be very gratefull aswell as everyone knows time is money now.

This is licensed under the GPL-V2 as to keep any versions of this OPEN-SOURCED and maybe grow into a bigger more comprehensive program and keep it free for all to use and modify as alot of programs like this exspect payment.

Current working Software can be downloaded here  [Serial-Comm-Tester Download](https://goo.gl/1C23rv)

******************** Plans for the future ***********************

I wish to add other protocols and additional features , hopefully with the help of Contributors from Github and make this an easy to use , fucntional and comprehesive FREE Serial communcations test tool available .

This is an essential tool for any developer wanting to Implement a proprietary Protocol or to get a project up and running faster for popular protocols.

I will update the usage when i get time , i thought i would share this project and see if it can grow further here.

Happy coding.

Philip
