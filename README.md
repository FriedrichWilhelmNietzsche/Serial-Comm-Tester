Serial Communications Test Tool / Graph / Auto Logging / CRC / Checksum / BCC Calculator and other features


This started as a basic Serial communications test tool that i created for when at work to make my life easier.

Alot of other Serial programs are BUGGY as hell so i made my own and added to it over time.

My Goal is to add features like Modbus , 12c and other protocols or if someone whats to contribute i would be very gratefull aswell.

This is licensed under the GPL-V2 as to keep any versions of this OPEN-SOURCED and maybe grow into a bigger more comprehensive program and keep it free for all to use and modify as alot of programs like this exspect payment.

This test tool can be used to test Serial to USB cables (loop TX - RX).

Test Serial cables to check for data loss ( cable lenghts etc..).

Test communications by sending commands ( there are lots of settings ) to a device like Arduino , Rasberry Pi, Modems , Embedded devices , Tank gauges, Printers, RFID readers etc..

This can also be used to test different protocols as trial and error can be a pain and this will get you on your feet faster and has the source code for different CRC , Checksums and BCC (block check characters).

This test tool can also be used to work out a CRC , Checksum or BCC as these can be a pain to work out.

(ALL OF THE CRC , Checksums, BCC have been tested against other test tools but here you have the source code) ;-)

It can also be used to test RS232 , RS485 , RS422 as these are serial medium's.

It can be used as a basic listener to decode protocols and read traffic from RS485 and RS422 (RS232 is peer to peer and will only allow read and write master to master).

I will update the usage when i get time , i thought i would share this project and see if it can grow further here.

Happy coding.

Philip
